## CENG 463 - Introduction to Machine Learning    

#### Homework 3: Clustering Techniques (Due: 29.12.2024)  
- [x] **Task 1: Data Preparation**  
  - Download the Chest X-ray Pneumonia dataset from Kaggle.  
  - Load images, explore the dataset, and display the first 5 images.  
  - Check and report the number of images in each category.  

- [x] **Task 2: Dimensionality Reduction**  
  - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**  
    - Reduce data dimensionality and transform features into 2D space.  
  - **t-SNE:**  
    - Further reduce dimensionality and visualize data points in 2D.  
    - Compare visualizations from PCA and t-SNE.  

- [x] **Task 3: Clustering**  
  - **K-Means Clustering:**  
    - Apply K-Means on reduced features.  
    - Determine the optimal number of clusters (`k`) and justify the choice.  
  - **Alternative Clustering Method:**  
    - Implement another clustering technique, compare with K-Means, and explain performance differences.  

- [x] **Task 4: Query Mechanism**  
  - Select a query image from the test dataset.  
  - Use K-Means clusters to find the top 3 most similar images (Euclidean distance).  
  - Display the query image and results in a subplot with proper labels.  

- [x] **Task 5: Evaluation**  
  - **Clustering Evaluation:**  
    - Use metrics like homogeneity and completeness to assess clustering.  
  - **Query-Based Performance:**  
    - Evaluate using metrics like precision@3 and recall@3.  
    - Discuss results and justify the chosen metrics.
