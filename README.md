## CENG 463 - Introduction to Machine Learning (Homework 1)

### To-Do
- [x] **Task 1: Data Loading and Exploratory Data Analysis**
  - Load the heart disease dataset.
  - Identify features and target variables.
  - Check for missing values.
  - Display dataset insights using `data.head()`.  

- [x] **Task 2: Correlation Analysis**
  - Implement and compute Pearson correlation.
  - Filter features with absolute correlation > 0.3.
  - Identify the most correlated feature and its importance.  

- [x] **Task 3: Simple Linear Regression**
  - Implement simple linear regression function manually.
  - Calculate coefficients, generate predictions, and visualize results.  

- [x] **Task 4: Multiple Linear Regression**
  - Use top 5 correlated features for model training.
  - Implement regression, calculate MSE, and compare actual vs. predicted values.  

- [x] **Task 5: Logistic Regression**
  - Train logistic regression using scikit-learn.
  - Evaluate accuracy and visualize results.  

- [x] **Task 6: Polynomial Regression**
  - Use PolynomialFeatures and train a regression model.
  - Evaluate model performance using MSE and visualize results.  

- [x] **Performance Comparison**
  - Compare all models using performance metrics in a table.
  - Identify the best-fitting model and justify your choice.
